To address your query about laying out Text(card.suit.rawValue) in the center of the card like in the attached image of a 5 of Spades, I’ll provide a solution that replicates the described layout using SwiftUI. The image shows a 5 of Spades with five spade symbols arranged in a specific pattern: two at the top (with the left slightly lower than the right), one in the center, and two at the bottom (with the left slightly higher than the right). Here’s how you can achieve this in your CardView.

### Step 1: Define the Suit Enum
The suit of a playing card can be one of four options, each with a corresponding symbol and color (red for hearts and diamonds, black for clubs and spades). We'll use an enum with raw values for the symbols and a computed property for the color.

```swift
import SwiftUI

enum Suit: String {
    case hearts = "♥️"
    case diamonds = "♦️"
    case clubs = "♣️"
    case spades = "♠️"
    
    var color: Color {
        switch self {
        case .hearts, .diamonds:
            return .red
        case .clubs, .spades:
            return .black
        }
    }
}
```
